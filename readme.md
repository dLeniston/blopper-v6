###Blopper - Blog Site###

This blog site, named _Blopper_,is part of a number of prototypes developed as part of my fourth year project as part of the project module for _Waterford Institute of Technology_.
The blog is built using Node.js and Express, also making use of packages such as Passport.js for authentication. The hosted prototype can be found on [Heroku](http://blopper-v6.herokuapp.com/blogs).
